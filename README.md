# Vim Flow
> A framework for developing from within vim. Execute your project or file from one vim command. 

## Installation

This plugin was built on mac and has only been tested with mac for now. However, assuming your vim was included with python 2.7, you shouldn't have any problems. No external python modules are required.

~~~ vim
" vimrc
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()
